      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        As part of your participation in this program, you'll be asked to sign a
        non-disclosure agreement. There are important things you need to know
        about this agreement. In addition to reading the document itself
        carefully to understand its specific terms, review the materials on this
        page carefully to learn about NDAs in general. You'll be asked to
        confirm your completion of the material at the end of the page.

      <h2>What is an NDA?</h2>
      <p>
        A Non-Disclosure Agreement (NDA) is a legal contract that protects
        confidential information from being shared with unauthorized parties.
      </p>
      <p>
        By signing an NDA, the recipient agrees not to disclose any confidential
        information they have access to during the course of their work or
        business relationship with the disclosing party.
      </p>
      <p>An NDA is typically composed of the following key elements:</p>

      <div style="width: 80%; margin: auto">
        <div
          style="
            position: relative;
            padding-bottom: 56.25%;
            padding-top: 0;
            height: 0;
          "

      <h2>What are the key concepts of an NDA?</h2>
      <p>
        Your NDA will refer to a number of concepts that have specific legal
        meanings. Mouse over each item below to learn more about what it means
        in the context of your non-disclosure agreement.

      <h2>When could I breach an NDA?</h2>
      <p>
        Sticking with your NDA might seem simple: just don't talk about it. It's
        not always so straightforward, however, and you may encounter situations where
        there's pressure to share information that would break your NDA or where you're
        discussing information prohibited by your NDA, but it isn't obvious.
      </p>
      <p>
        The following interactive scenario offers an example of a situation
        (based on one that actually occured for one of our students) in which
        one might inadvertantly reveal information prohibited by their NDA.
      </p>
